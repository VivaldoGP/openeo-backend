# OpenEO backend

This project aims to create an API to access the available OpenEO data, as well as to perform basic tasks and processes, with the main focus being the generation of time series of spectral indices.

Subsequently, this API will be consumed by a frontend that allows the user to interact with the data without needing advanced programming knowledge. For this, it is essential that the user registers [here](https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/login-actions/registration?client_id=cdse-public&tab_id=1FG5WxDLqN0) and provides their credentials to perform tasks that require authentication.
